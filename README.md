# Notebooks
1. [Multi-resolution hash encoding](./multiresolution-hashing.ipynb) Implementation of the method described here https://nvlabs.github.io/instant-ngp/assets/mueller2022instant.pdf for 2D images.
2.  [Bundle-Adjusting Radiance Fields](./barf2D.ipynb) Example of how the idea described here https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06405 can be applied to 2D images. In the example the algorithm is given two different crops of the same image and it recovers the relative transformation between them.
3. [Data assimlation with PyTorch example](./data-assimilation.ipynb) Example of how PyTorch can be used to estimate parameters in a dynamical system when given the model (as a system of ODEs) and a time series of measurements.
